# Inspired by CS50x

This is a project work written by me, some of the projects shown here are the answers in some of my codes written in my projects in CS50. Please do note that I don't wish to publicize the answers for people to copy, I just wanted to showcase my work here, If you copy my code, you copied it at your own risk!

I only wished to showcase a skill of mine which I learned from actively participating in the CS50x course organized by Harvard and Yale.
